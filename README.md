-[ Model Building](#ModelBuilding)
-[ Model Training and Evaluation](#ModelTrainingandEvaluation)
## Environment Setup
- You started by importing the necessary libraries and frameworks, such as those for data analysis and machine learning, to set up your working environment.

## Data Preprocessing
- You acquired the relevant data for the breast cancer detection problem.
- You performed various data exploration and analysis techniques to understand the dataset, such as data visualization and statistical analysis.
- You cleaned and preprocessed the data, handling any missing values, outliers, or other data quality issues.

## Model Building
- You chose to use a Linear Regression model as the machine learning algorithm for this problem.
- Linear Regression is a suitable choice for a problem like breast cancer detection, where the goal is to predict a binary outcome (presence or absence of cancer).    

## Model Training and Evaluation
- You split the data into training and validation sets, using a 70:30 ratio, to properly evaluate the model's performance.
- You trained the Linear Regression model on the training data and evaluated its performance on the validation set.
- The results you obtained seem to be quite impressive, indicating that the model is performing well in detecting breast cancer.
